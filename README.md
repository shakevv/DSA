Here I have some basic important data structures and algorithms implementations.

Data Structures:

  *Linear Structures:
  
    - Singly-Linked List implementation
    
   *Non-linear Structures:
   
      - BST (binary search tree) with all the important methods
      - AVL Tree (self-balancing binary search tree) with all basic methods that include rotations. Everything else is the same as in the BST implementation.


Algorithms:

  *(Fast) Comparison sorting algorithms:
  
    - Merge sort 
    - Quick sort 
  *Non-comparison sorting algorithms: 
   
    - Counting sort

  *Searching algorithms:
     
     -Binary Search
