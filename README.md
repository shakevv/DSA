Here I wrote some basic important data structures and algorithms.

As a data structures we have:

  *Linear Structures:
  
    - Singly-Linked List implementation
    
   *Non-linear data structures:
   
      - BST (binary search tree) with all the important methods
      - AVL Tree (self-balancing binary search tree) with all basic methods that include rotations. Everything else is the same as in the BST implementation.


As algorithms we have:
  *(Fast) Sorting algorithms:
  
    - Merge sort
    - Quick sort
